Can you change the todo app so it saves and retrieves the data from a server.

Server:
	http://api.beta2.se/yourName-list

	Alternatively:
	Run the server locally 
	
	To install:
	git clone https://github.com/tablackmore/memoryDataService.git
	cd memoryDataService
	npm install
	node index.js

	http://localhost:14782/yourName-list

	Which ever you use the api is:

	get /yourName-list  <-- returns an array of list objects. One object per item

	get /yourName-list/1 <-- returns object with id 1 from list
	put /yourName-list/1 data --> updates the object with id 1 to be the data you sent or creates the object
	del /yourName-list/1 deletes the object with id 1 from list
	post /yourName-list data --> creates the object in the list and returns its id.

	The data is stored purely in memory on the server i.e. if you restart the service it will reset all your data.


1) Rewrite the code in todo.js so the list items are those that exist on the server. Make sure you can create items, read items and delete items.
