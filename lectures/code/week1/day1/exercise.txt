Create a simple todo list app.

1) Create an html view containing: 
	an empty html list (The todo list), 
	an html input text box that you will use to add new data to your list,
	an html button also used to add data to your list.

2) Create a javascript file containing an angular module called todo and a controller called TodoCtrl.

3) In the controller define an array called list fill it with some dummy text data. Ensure that this array is attached or defined to the $scope.

4) Create a function called addItem again attached to the scope. This function should take a list item and push it into the list.

5) Wire up your html view so that it uses your module and controller. (ng-app, ng-controller)

6) Get your html list to display the entire contents of the list in your controller. (ng-repeat)

7) Allow your list to be added to by wiring up the text box and the button to the addItem function in your controller. (ng-model, ng-click).
